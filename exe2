#   An ethical phishing simulation platform is a tool or service that allows organizations to conduct 
    simulated phishing attacks on their own employees. 
1.   Assess vulnerability: Identify how susceptible employees are to various phishing tactics.
2.   Educate and train: Teach employees to recognize, report, and appropriately respond to phishing attempts in a safe, controlled environment.
3.   Measure effectiveness: Track improvements in employee awareness and behavior over time.
4.   Strengthen security posture: Ultimately reduce the human risk factor in cybersecurity by turning employees into a strong line of defense.
